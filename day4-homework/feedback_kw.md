# day 4 homework feedback

I see one heatmap (the one without multiple hypothesis testing) -- overall it's very good, but it must be passing the strings "n_tosses" and "prob_heads" to `xticklabels` and `yticklabels` within the `sns.heatmap()` function respectively. You want to set those arguments equal to the actual arrays so that the tick labels are the values within those arrays.

Please upload the second heatmpa, your code, and your README with the comments/observations for A, C, and D
