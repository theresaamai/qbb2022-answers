Great work Theresa! There are just a few things we're missing:

1. Missing Question 2 (-0.5 point)
2. Your code for Question 4A looks just about right. It looks like you got the main idea that we want to search all the contigs in each of the bins against the assembly file. However, I don't see your answer for Question 4A, we also want to look at specfic parts of the taxonomy, not necessarily the whole thing (-0.75 point)

Everything else looks great though!
