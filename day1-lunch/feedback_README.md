Question 2c: I like this idea, but how would you figure out how many exons each gene has?
Question 3c: So firstly, unfortunately, `sort` won't work here because the output of `uniq` is not tab delimited, and has leading spaces, BUT I like the idea. This technique, however, will tell us which state has the most regions, not necessarily which state covers the largest fraction of the genome. To answer that question, we would need to calculate the length of each region, and then figure out which annotation has the greatest combined length. How might we do that...
Question 5: Nice work so far, just make sure to finish the question.

Great job!
