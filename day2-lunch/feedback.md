Overall, this looks good. Your comments are clear and your logic is good. There are a couple of small bugs. First, when you enumerate through the lines of the file, you keep track of the line number with `i`. Then inside that loop you have another 2 for loops that also use `i`, changing its value. This really only affects being able to print out the line number for malformed lines. You also forgot to split fields[11], which means that when you try the type convertion, it fails and considers it a malformed line. Finally, if there is an error in the first try statement in the for loop (checking fields 8, 10 and 11), the line is still included because the code keeps going after the except statement. If blockStarts or blockSizes is a different length than the number in blockCount, the error is never printed. All in all, these are minor errors but can have a larger impact. They're hard to track down because the code runs. It feels like you've got a pretty good handle on this level of coding. Keep up the good work!
