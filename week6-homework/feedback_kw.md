## Week 6 -- 10 points possible

1 + 1 + _ + _ + _ + _ + _ + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 8 of 10 points possible

1. Given data question: What percentage of reads are valid interactions?

2. Given data question: What constitutes the majority of invalid 3C pairs?/What does it mean?

3. Script set up to (0.5 pts each)

  * read in data  
  * Filter data based on location  

4. Script set up to log transform the scores

5. Script set up to shift the data by subtracting minimum value

6. Script set up to convert sparse data into square matrix

7. Script set up to (0.33 pts each)

  * remove distance dependent signal
  * smooth
  * subtract

8. Turned in the plot of the 3 heatmaps (ddCTCF, dCTCF, and difference) for subset dataset (0.33 pts each ddCTCF/dCTCF/difference)

9. Turned in the plot of the 3 heatmaps (ddCTCF, dCTCF, and difference) for full dataset (0.33 pts each ddCTCF/dCTCF/difference)

10. Heatmap questions (0.33 pts each)

  * See the highlighted difference from the original figure?
  * impact of sequencing depth? --> It might not change the interpretation of the tads, but it certainly does decrease the noise/smooth the signal in the data
  * highlighted signal indicates?

Possible Bonus points:

1. Insulation script set up to (0.25 pts each)

  * read in data
  * filter data based on location
  * log transform the data
  * shift the data by subtracting minimum value

2. Insulation script set up to (0.5 pts each)

  * convert sparse data into square matrix
  * find the insulation score by taking mean of 5x5 squares of interactions around target

3. Turned in the plot of the heatmap + insulation scores below (0.5 pts each panel)
