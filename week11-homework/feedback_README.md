This is really good! There a few minor issues:
1. It looks like you plotted your UMAP without coloring by clusters, not a big deal though, because your t-SNE is fine (no points deducted)
2. Although your code looks correct, for the `rank_genes_groups` portion, it looks like you may have accidently plotted PCA again. I'm guessing you fixed the issue in your code, but didn't update the plots (-0.5 point)

Everything else looks awesome!
