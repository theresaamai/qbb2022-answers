## Week 5 -- 10 points possible

1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1  = 8 points out of 10

1. Filter reads, Call peaks, and intersect peaks across Sox2 replicates (0.33 points each)

2. Find the number of total peaks and overlapping peaks for Klf4 and Sox2 (0.5 for commands, 0.5 for result)

3. scale bedgraph files (4 different datasets, 0.25 each)

* didn't see code for this in the README --> +0

4. crop bedgraph files (4 different datasets, 0.25 each)

* didn't see code for this in the README --> +0

5. python script for plotting

* nice script!

6. 4 panel plot of read pile ups

* good plot overall
* Nice use of the tick marks and tick mark labels so that we can see the different scales. Most would prefer using the same scale/max value for all four subplots on the y-axis.
* Would be nice to have y-axis labels or titles or legends to say which transcription factor was ChIP'd for each subpanel

7. motif finding sort intersected sox2 replicate narrow peak by 5th columm, keep first 300 lines, awk command for reformatting (0.33 each)

8. use samtools faidx to extract peak sequences and meme-chip to perform motif finding (0.5 each)

9. download and unpack motif database

10. match profiles from tomtom for klf4 and sox2 (0.5 for commands, 0.5 for result)
